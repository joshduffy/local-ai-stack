# Dissolving CAPTCHA: Proof of Humanity, Subject to Availability

CAPTCHAs exist to prove you're human. The Dissolving CAPTCHA adds a caveat: prove you're human, quickly, before the evidence disappears.

## The Problem with Regular CAPTCHAs

Traditional CAPTCHAs give you distorted text and unlimited time to squint at it. Some even have audio alternatives. They're practically accommodating. This felt like an oversight.

## The Solution

In Dissolving CAPTCHA, the text you need to type starts clear but immediately begins to decay. Characters fade. Letters scramble into their confusable cousins—O becomes 0, I becomes 1, and for one chaotic moment you're not sure if that's an S or a 5.

By level three, the characters are glitching. By level five, they're dissolving into abstract expressionism before your eyes.

## The Philosophy

There's something honest about a verification system that degrades over time. Real-world verification works the same way. Your passport expires. Your ID fades. Your certainty about whether you locked the door decreases with distance from the house.

The Dissolving CAPTCHA simply accelerates this natural entropy. It asks: can you prove you're human right now? Not in thirty seconds. Now.

## Technical Notes

The game uses increasingly aggressive animation effects: fade, dissolve, glitch, and scramble. Characters may briefly transform into visually similar alternatives before disappearing entirely. This is by design. Your frustration is also by design.

## How to Win

Type fast. Trust your first instinct. And maybe lower your expectations about what "proving humanity" should feel like. Because honestly, if an AI can solve this, they've earned it.
