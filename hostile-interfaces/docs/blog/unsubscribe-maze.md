# Unsubscribe Maze: The Gauntlet of Letting Go

You want to cancel your subscription. The company wants you to reconsider. Between you and freedom lies an obstacle course of emotional manipulation, hidden requirements, and buttons that don't do what they say.

## The Experience

Unsubscribe Maze replicates the modern cancellation flow in all its hostile glory. You'll encounter:

- Sad mascots who can't believe you're leaving
- "Are you sure?" dialogs nested inside other "Are you sure?" dialogs
- Special offers that appear only after you've committed to leaving
- Exit surveys with no option for "I just want out"
- Buttons labeled "Cancel" that cancel the cancellation

This is based on real patterns observed in the wild. If anything, it's gentler.

## Dark Pattern Taxonomy

The game teaches through exposure. By the time you escape, you'll recognize:

**Confirm-shaming**: When the cancel button says "No, I don't want to save money" in shameful lowercase.

**Roach motel**: Easy to check in, impossible to check out.

**Misdirection**: The prominent button does the opposite of what you want.

**Obstruction**: Adding unnecessary steps to discourage completion.

These aren't hypothetical. These are standard practice.

## The Emotional Layer

What makes Unsubscribe Maze particularly uncomfortable is the emotional manipulation. The system guilt-trips you. It reminds you of what you'll lose. It shows you a sad cartoon character who represents the service's feelings about your departure.

You, a human being, might briefly feel bad about disappointing a piece of software. This is the design working as intended.

## Freedom

When you finally cancel, you win. But the victory screen gently reminds you that your cancellation will be processed in 3-5 business days, and you can always resubscribe if you change your mind.

Because of course it does.
