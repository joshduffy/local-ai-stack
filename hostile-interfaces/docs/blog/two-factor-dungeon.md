# Two-Factor Dungeon: Security Is a Journey, Not a Destination

You need to log in. You have credentials. The system requires two-factor authentication. This is where things get complicated.

## The Premise

Two-Factor Dungeon presents you with a login challenge where the second factor keeps changing. First it wants a code from your authenticator app. Then it wants a code texted to your phone. Then it wants you to click a link in an email. Then it wants biometric verification that your laptop definitely doesn't support.

The system remembers your failures. It learns from them. It adapts. Each wrong attempt teaches it what you can't do, and it helpfully suggests that next time.

## Why Two-Factor

Real two-factor authentication is already a puzzle. Which app did I use? Is it Google Authenticator or Authy? Did I set this up with my old phone number? Why is the code expiring while I'm still typing it?

Two-Factor Dungeon turns this confusion into mechanics. The game isn't unfair—it's consistently following rules. The rules just happen to shift based on your interaction history.

## The Learning Curve

Early attempts teach you what methods exist. Middle attempts teach you when each method triggers. Late attempts—if you're paying attention—reveal the pattern.

The solution exists. It's not random. But finding it requires treating your own failure history as data. Which, honestly, is how most authentication experiences work.

## Security Wisdom

The game offers no commentary on whether two-factor authentication is good or bad. It simply observes that the more secure we make things, the harder they become to use. This is not a bug in security. It is the fundamental trade-off.
