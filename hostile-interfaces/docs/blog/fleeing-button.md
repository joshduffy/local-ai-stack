# Fleeing Button: The Confirmation Dialog With Commitment Issues

You've been selected to receive a FREE premium subscription. All you have to do is click "Yes, I Want It!" Easy. Unless the button doesn't want to be clicked.

## The Concept

The Fleeing Button is a confirmation dialog where the confirm button runs away from your cursor. Not metaphorically. Literally. As your mouse approaches, the button panics and relocates to somewhere else on the screen.

This is not a bug. This is the entire game.

## Why It Exists

Every dark pattern guide warns about "confirm-shaming"—those dialogs where the cancel button says things like "No, I don't want to save money" in tiny gray text while the confirm button screams at you in neon. But what if the dialog took a different approach? What if it was physically impossible to confirm?

The button doesn't want you to commit. The button has seen other users click things they regret. The button is trying to protect you. The button is also getting smaller and faster with each successful click, so maybe don't read too much into its motivations.

## The Escalation

First click: the button is merely nervous.
Second click: the button is actively evasive.
Third click: the button begins teleporting.
Fourth click: the button is visibly panicking.
Fifth click: you win, but at what cost?

## The Message

Sometimes the most hostile interface isn't the one that tricks you into clicking. It's the one that won't let you click at all. The button that flees is protecting you from something. Maybe from itself. Maybe from the commitment of a premium subscription. Maybe from the hubris of thinking you could click anything you wanted.

Either way, you'll work for this confirmation. You'll earn it. And when you finally catch that button, you'll feel something. I'm not saying it's accomplishment. But it's definitely something.
